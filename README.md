## Bio

With a foundation in marketing from Penn State, my journey took an unconventional turn when I discovered a profound interest in technology. This led me to teach myself Python and SQL, setting the stage for a rewarding 5+ year career as a data analyst in adtech, ecommerce, and risk spaces.

My passion for building and creativity, coupled with years of self-taught coding and side projects, steered me towards my true calling: software engineering. Currently enrolled in an intensive coding bootcamp, I am eagerly bridging the gap between data analytics and software development, armed with a unique blend of analytical prowess, marketing insights, and a relentless drive to innovate within the tech industry.
